# Course summary

## Week 1
Functions are first-class citizens, just any other variable. 
Functions can therefor be passed around like arguments, returned from functions etc.
It's good functional programming style to break down code into many small functions.

Call-by-name vs call-by-value is important to remeber for deciding on how to call a method.
Def x = loop works but val x = loop will not work. Get Call-by-name by def function(x : => Type).

*Recursion.* In Scala you always need to define the return type in order for type inference to work.
Scala relies on Blocks to define scope. Blocks equal the last expression in their definition.
*Tail recursion*.
